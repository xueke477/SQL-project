# Overview

This project uses PostgreSQL to query a [sample database](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/). The final outcome is a visualized [presentation](SQL-presentation.pdf). On each page of the presentation, a question is asked, and a visual chart is used to demonstrate the answer. The chart is produced via Google Spreadsheet from the output csv file of one of the four SQL queries: [page1.sql](page1.sql), [page2.sql](page2.sql), [page3.sql](page3.sql) and [page4.sql](page4.sql). The codes run without error on `PostgreSQL 9.6.9`. The four outpus csv files are also included.
